# BookWorm

Welcome to BookWorm!

The BookWorm app allows you to search through a vast collection of books and other reading materials that you can checkout for your reading pleasure.

You can view all of the books in your current possession with active return by dates.

Our app also allows you to return one book at a time, or even all of your books in a single instance.  Wow, you must be a fast reader!

If you're feeling spontaneous, you can use our random book generator to produce a random book from the library!

Beware a user cannot checkout a book that has been checked out by another user.  However, we will provide you with a date indicating when the book has to be returned by.

Our library allows you keep the book for 7 days before it needs to be returned.  Once returned it will become available again for all users.

The BookWorm app aims to make your book searching journey much more pleasant.  Why drag confuse yourself with the Dewey Decimal system, when you can just use our app!
