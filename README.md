# BookWorm

Welcome to BookWorm!

The BookWorm app allows you to search through a vast collection of books and other reading materials that you can checkout for your reading pleasure.

You can view all of the books in your current possession with active return by dates.

Our app also allows you to return one book at a time, or even all of your books in a single instance.  Wow, you must be a fast reader!

If you're feeling spontaneous, you can use our random book generator to produce a random book from the library!

Beware a user cannot checkout a book that has been checked out by another user.  However, we will provide you with a date indicating when the book has to be returned by.

Our library allows you keep the book for 7 days before it needs to be returned.  Once returned it will become available again for all users.

The BookWorm app aims to make your book searching journey much more pleasant.  Why drag confuse yourself with the Dewey Decimal system, when you can just use our app!



## How to Use BookWorm

### Hint - IT'S EASY!
  Once the BookWorm application is started it will prompt you to enter your name.  This allows us to keep track of your checkout history, as well as, the books you have currently active in your checkout cart.

  You will see a list of commands to choose from.  These commands are what make our app so easy to use.

    1. Search
    2. View your checkouts
    3. Return Book
    4. Return all Books
    5. Choose a random book for me
    6. Exit



1. Searching for a book will ask you to type in the title of the book you are looking for.  Entering this search will return a list of 10 books to choose from.
Don't worry, if you do not see the book you are searching for, you can search again with more specific keywords.

    EX: Searching Harry Potter
      VS.
    Searching Harry Potter Azkaban

  Once you see the book you are searching for on the list, please select the appropriate index associated with that book.  This will check the books availability - if it is checked out, sorry, you will not be able to check it out until the user reading it has returned it.  We allow 7 days per checkout of a book, so if you want to check it out again you want to be quick.

2. The app also allows you to view your current list of checked out books.  This list comes fully equipt with a checkout and return date to ensure you get your books back on time.

3. Our return book command will give you the opportunity to return a book on your own schedule.  By simply selecting the index number of the book taken from your view checkouts cart.  You can return the book making it available for other users.  Thank you for your punctuality :)

4. If you're in a rush, our return all command gives you the power to return all of your books at once.  Have to go on vacation somewhere? Return all!  On the run from the feds and don't want a late fee? Return all! Qualifying for the Jamaican bobsled team and need to catch a plane to calgary?  Return All!  It's that easy!

5.  Feelin' Lucky?  Give our random book generator a go!  This feature will pluck a random book from the google books database and give you the option to check it out if you'd like.  Feel free to mash this button as many times as you'd like.

Last, but most importantly, HAVE FUN.  This app is meant to explore the plethora of literature available to us through the google books library.  Remember to check the page count though.  You wouldn't want to start off reading a 1,200 page book!  Start out wherever you feel comfortable and get reading!
